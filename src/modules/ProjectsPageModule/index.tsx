                One of the projects I’ve worked on is the front-end development
                of the Hamrahtel website, an online platform for selling mobile
                phones and accessories. My role was to help build a smooth,
                user-friendly interface that makes browsing and shopping easy
                and intuitive. I worked with technologies like HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, and React to create responsive layouts and
                interactive components. A big focus of the project was making
                the user experience seamless across different devices, and I
                also paid close attention to design consistency and performance
                optimization. It was a great opportunity to apply my skills in a
                real-world e-commerce project and collaborate with a team of
                developers and designers.

                I’ve also been involved in the front-end development of GSM.ir,
                a well-known tech news and product review website in Iran. My
                main goal was to help improve the user interface and make the
                site more modern, responsive, and easy to navigate. I worked
                with React and styled-components to build reusable UI elements
                and ensure consistency across pages. Since GSM.ir has a lot of
                content—like articles, product comparisons, and specs—I focused
                on creating clean layouts and enhancing readability on both
                desktop and mobile. It was a challenging but really rewarding
                experience, especially working on performance improvements and
                implementing features that make the site more interactive and
                engaging for users.

                <p className="font-bold text-[#F9AD2A]">PRODUCT PLAN</p>I
                recently did an internship as a product designer, which gave me
                a great opportunity to explore the design side of tech more
                deeply. During the internship, I worked closely with both
                developers and product managers to design user-centered
                solutions—from wireframes to high-fidelity mockups. I learned a
                lot about user research, UI/UX principles, and how to think
                critically about product features and user flows. Tools like
                Figma became part of my daily workflow, and I really enjoyed the
                creative process of turning ideas into intuitive designs. It was
                a valuable experience that helped me better understand the full
                product development cycle and how design plays a key role in
                shaping digital experiences.
